I know currently the proactive chat uses a system different from the regular chat, aside from the four backend files mentioned. Please create a chat component from the regular chat and use it inside the proactive chat as well. The only difference in the frontend for a proactive chat compared to a regular chat should be the subheader with the title, timer, and buttons. The API calls should be exactly the same as the regular chat. The timer service, proactive trigger, persona management, and chat manager should all be independent. This aims to simplify how the proactive chat works; it should be no different from a regular chat, using the same API calls with streaming. Any change to the regular chat in the codebase should also affect the proactive chat since they should derive from the same component. I activated your plan mode, but before that, please evaluate my idea and say if it makes sense to implement.
