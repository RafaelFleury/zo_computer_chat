make a plan to add a button on the memory editing and adding on the frontend that will decide if a certain memory is put into the system message or not. change how memories are stored. we need: Memory type, memory description, memory title and complete memory and the boolean if they are put into the system message or not, and memory ID.
also change how list_memories work, sending only title, description and type to the context. also add a new tool get_memory by their title or ID. the full memory should only go to the context if the get_memory is called. also add a memory type called Skill. naturally the add_memory tool should be changed to apply he new parameters. ensure the new system is correctly saved and retrieved from the database. you may create a temporary file to migrate the old memories to the new system.
